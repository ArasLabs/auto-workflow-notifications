# Automatic Workflow Reminders and Notifications

To run automatic email notification remiders and acticity escalations of Workflows in Aras Innovator, you must have a method that executes these actions.

This project contains a Package of AML that contains two methods that can be used to execute these actions. Installation only requires the import of the package using the Solutions Upgrade Tool.

[Download the Solutions upgrade tool](https://www.aras.com/communityprojects/?projectid=DD32FF42D8B14CB28CD4732AAF2F5349)

Once installed, the methods can be called using the Aras Innovator Scheduler Service as a scheduled job.

Alternately, you could apply the methods to an Action and run them manually, but this should only be done during off hours.
